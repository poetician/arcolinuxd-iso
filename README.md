# arcolinuxd-iso

With this github you can build your own ArcoLinuxD version.

This dedicated version is for developing ArcoLinux with Spectrwm as its window manager.

Initial config only. Issues will come and go.

Application(s) required for this edition not normally in an ArcoLinux ISO: CherryTree

Issues so far: Kdenlive and Google Earth Pro do long load into assigned workspaces through autostart.

Addendum 01:

After some tinkering on other parts of the config and a reboot in VB, Kdenlive and Google Earth Pro autorun worked, but the apps did not go to their assigned workspaces, but workspace 1 instead.

Dmenu continues to load from CLI but not from the config.
